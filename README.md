# C Piscine

This repository documents my experience participating in the 42 Piscine (March 2025), an intensive 26-day C programming bootcamp designed as the final selection phase for becoming a 42 student.

## About 42 and the Piscine

42 is a tuition-free, peer-learning-based programming school with no traditional teachers or lectures. Students develop problem-solving and technical skills by working through coding projects independently and collaboratively.

The **Piscine** (French for "swimming pool") is an immersive training program where participants tackle progressively challenging exercises in the C programming language, reinforcing computational thinking, algorithmic problem-solving, and time management.

## Project Structure

This repository contains my solutions to various Piscine projects:

## Key Takeaways

- Understanding low-level memory management and efficiency.
- Developing problem-solving skills without relying on standard libraries.
- Learning to write clean and modular C code.
- Adapting to an intense, self-driven learning environment.

## Tips for Future Pisciners

1. **Prepare in Advance**: Watching CS50x up to Week 5 helps cover key C concepts.
2. **Manage Your Time**: Start early, especially with projects like C00 and C01.
3. **Use Peer Reviews**: Evaluating others' code is a great way to learn.
4. **Get Comfortable with VIM**: Exams may not have VSCode available.
5. **Participate in Rushes**: At least one is required, and they help with problem-solving.

## Exam Guide

- **Registration Tips**:
  - Register for both the Exam Event and the Exam Subject **BEFORE** the exam to avoid automatic failure.
  - Use 'exam' as both the username and password (not your usual credentials).
  - Open Terminal and enter 'examshell', then log in with your normal username and password (your password will not be visible while typing this time).
  - Log in to examshell within 15 minutes, or you will fail by default.

- **Exam Topics**:
  - Exam00: Functions, loops, conditions, arrays, strings.
  - Exam01: Exam00 + Command-line arguments.
  - Exam02: Exam00 + Exam01 + Memory allocation (`malloc`) + Recursion.
  - Final Exam: All above + Function pointers + Linked lists.

- **Submission Tips**:
  - Use `grademe` in the examshell to submit.
  - Debug with available traces if possible.
  - No need for `norminette` in exams.
